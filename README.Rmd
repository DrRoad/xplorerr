## Overview

xplorerr provides a set of tools for interactive data exploration:

- Descirptive statistics
- Inferential statistics
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- RFM Analysis
- Data visualization
    - ggplot2
    - plotly
    - rbokeh
    - highcharter

## Installation

You can install xplorerr from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rsquaredacademy/xplorerr")
```

## Usage

#### Descirptive statistics

Generate descriptive statistics such as measures of location,
dispersion, frequency tables, cross tables, group summaries and multiple
one/two way tables. Visualize and compute percentiles/probabilities of 
normal, t, f, chi square and binomial distributions.

```{r descriptive, eval=FALSE}
app_descriptive()
```

#### Inferential statistics

Select set of parametric and non-parametric statistical tests. 'inferr' builds upon the solid set of
statistical tests provided in 'stats' package by including additional data types as inputs, expanding and
restructuring the test results. The tests included are t tests, variance tests, proportion tests, 
chi square tests, Levene's test, McNemar Test, Cochran's Q test and Runs test.

```{r inference, eval=FALSE}
app_inference()
```

#### Linear regression

Tools designed to make it easier for users, particularly beginner/intermediate R users 
to build ordinary least squares regression models. Includes comprehensive regression output, 
heteroskedasticity tests, collinearity diagnostics, residual diagnostics, measures of influence, 
model fit assessment and variable selection procedures.


```{r linear, eval=FALSE}
app_linear_regression()
```

#### Logistic regression

Tools designed to make it easier for beginner and intermediate users to build and validate 
binary logistic regression models. Includes bivariate analysis, comprehensive regression output, 
model fit statistics, variable selection procedures, model validation techniques and a 'shiny' 
app for interactive model building.

```{r logistic, eval=FALSE}
app_logistic_regression()
```

#### RFM Analysis

Tools for RFM (recency, frequency and monetary value) analysis. 
Generate RFM score from both transaction and customer level data. Visualize the
relationship between recency, frequency and monetary value using heatmap, 
histograms, bar charts and scatter plots.

```{r rfm, eval=FALSE}
app_rfm_analysis()
```

#### Data Visualization

Tools for interactive data visualization . Users can visualize data using 'ggplot2', 'plotly', 
'rbokeh' and 'highcharter' libraries. 

```{r visualize, eval=FALSE}
app_visualizer()
```
